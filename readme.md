# Pixcode
Pixcode is a nice and easy to implement way to encode your data to pixels. You can easily encode almost any file to pixels (also remember that huge files takes more time to encrypt and decrypt).

### Installation
First of all clone this repo using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xGeekHub/pixcode.git
```
then install requirements using:
```bash
python3 -m pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
after that for encoding, use `encode` or `encode_bytes` functions based on your needs.
And for decoding, use their correspondings, `decode` or `decode_bytes` functions based on your needs.
